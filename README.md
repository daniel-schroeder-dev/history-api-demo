## About

A simple example which demonstrates a way to use the History API to rewrite the URL to mimic changing pages on a static page. The user has the ability to bookmark the url and navigate to and from the url without page loads. Based on a project from [Dive Into HTML5 - History](http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html)

## TODO

1. Add more content and 'pages' to mimic the feel of a real site.
